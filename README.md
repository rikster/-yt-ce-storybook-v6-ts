# A Design Library Stack.
Storybook with React, TypeScript and Sketch

## Storybook Scripts

In the project root directory, you can run storybook:
### `yarn storybook`

## Thinking and Sources

Must be TypeScript to be compatible with base solutions.

[Storybook Docs w/ Create React App (CRA) & TypeScript](https://gist.github.com/shilman/bc9cbedb2a7efb5ec6710337cbd20c0c)

The point is to explore design systems; therefore moving designs from likes of Sketch to a live React
component library in StoryBook.

1. [Storybook to Sketch via storybook-addon-sketch](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-sketch)
2. Sketch to React via [Stratos or SketchToReact](https://sketch2react.io/)
    - which includes [real time development](https://sketch2react.io/blog/how-to-do-real-time-component-development-with-sketch-stratos-storybook/)
3. Or manually both ways.      

Other tools and add-ons:

- addon-essentials
  - docs<br>
  - controls
  - actions
  - viewport
  - backgrounds
  - toolbars & global
  - measure
  - outline
- addon-docs
  - do i need this, if it comes in essentials?
